# Phishing Detection Information Security

## Overview

Phishing is a form of social engineering attack that is frequently employed to steal user information, such as login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted
entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.

## What is the way we are proposing to address the problem?
We are working on the dataset provided by Kaggle which has a total of 50 features, contributing to
Phishing in general. We have utilized two models, a Random forest classifier and logistic regression to
find the optimal number of features that contribute to phishing, hence we will be getting the top listed
factors related to phishing.
We have the following evaluation metric:
● Accuracy Score
● F1 Score
● Support
● Precision
● Recall
